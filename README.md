# LexiCork

I created this website for the 3rd Milestone Project on Data Centric Development, at Code Institute's Diploma in Software Development course. 

Visit the live [website.](https://lexicork.herokuapp.com/)

This website is a dictionary of the colloquial language in Co. Cork, Ireland. The name is taken from the word 'lexicon', which is another word for dictionary and the word Cork replacing the end for a play on words that hopefully gives an idea of what the website is about.

# UX and UI

  * ## Project Research

    Slang words from other countries or dialects are really popular nowadays. There are entire accounts on social media dedicted to this.

    * ## Research Analysis

      I created this website in order to allow people a place to access the many words of my own home county.


  * ## Persona and Their Goals

    * The ideal visitor to this website is someone who loves words and their meanings.

    * They are looking for a website that allows them to find new words easily. 
    
    * They are looking to return to the site and revisit their favourite words.

    * They want to be able to share the words they find easily.

  * ## Owner Goals
    1. Increase traffic to the site.
    2. Keep existing visitors interested.
  * ## User Stories
    1. As a user visiting the site for the first time, I want to navigate the site intuitively.
    2. As a user, I want to know what information this site provides.
    3. As a user, I want to be able to see an alphabetical list of words to explore.
    4. As a user, I want to find something with a bit of humour.
    5. As a user, I want to be able to access your social media accounts.
  * ## Wireframes
    * Wireframe available [here.](docs/desktop-wireframe.pdf)
  * ## Design
    * ## Colour Scheme
      I wanted to keep the palette for this website simple. I choose the colour for the font to reflect the county colours of Cork, white and red - blood and bandages.
      
      I chose a background image of an open dictionary to help give the user an idea of the websites function from the outset. It blends seemlessly into the background with an opaque overlay. ![Am I Responsive image of how the website looks across different browser sizes](docs/am-i-responsive.png)
